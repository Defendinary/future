# Future Framework Documentation

Welcome to the Future framework documentation. Future is a minimalist, decorator-free ASGI web framework for Python that emphasizes clarity and explicit code patterns.

## What is Future?

Future is a modern Python web framework built on ASGI that:

- **Avoids decorators** - Uses explicit, clear code patterns
- **Minimalist design** - Focuses on simplicity and readability
- **Type-safe** - Full mypy support with comprehensive type hints
- **Modern features** - WebSocket support, GraphQL, scheduled tasks, and more
- **Developer-friendly** - Built-in testing, CLI tools, and comprehensive documentation

## Key Features

- **HTTP Routing** - Simple, parameterized routes with full HTTP method support
- **Middleware System** - Flexible middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- **WebSocket Support** - Real-time communication with WebSocket routes
- **GraphQL Integration** - Built-in GraphQL support with Strawberry
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Native cron-like scheduler for background tasks
- **Lifespan Management** - Startup and shutdown task coordination
- **Testing Tools** - Built-in test client for HTTP and WebSocket testing
- **CLI Tools** - Project scaffolding and route listing utilities

## Quick Start

```python
from future.application import Future
from future.controllers import WelcomeController
from future.routing import Get

routes = [
    Get(path="/", endpoint=WelcomeController.root, name="Welcome")
]

app = Future()
app.add_routes(routes=routes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
